# Session Manager UI Improvements

## Changes Made

### 1. Clean Tab Design
- **Removed sub-rows**: Eliminated the extra information row below the server name
- **Simplified layout**: Only server name/IP and close button (×) are displayed
- **Modern flat design**: Clean, minimalist appearance with subtle hover effects

### 2. Fixed Close Button
- **Proper DOM cleanup**: Close button now properly removes session and cleans up DOM elements
- **Better visual feedback**: Improved hover states and positioning  
- **Consistent styling**: Modern × symbol with proper spacing and alignment
- **Robust event handling**: Uses button elements with proper pointer events for reliable clicking
- **Event propagation**: Prevents conflicts with tab selection by stopping event propagation

### 3. Fixed Reconnect Functionality
- **Clean reconnection**: Closes the existing session and opens a new one
- **Eliminated DOM errors**: Fixed "NotFoundError: removeChild" by proper cleanup
- **Smooth transition**: Added small delay for better UX during reconnection

### 4. Enhanced Context Menu
- **Improved theming**: Better support for dark/light themes
- **Better positioning**: Context menu positioning and cleanup
- **Cleaner actions**: Simplified menu items with proper event handling

## Key Features

### Tab Structure
```javascript
// Clean tab with only essential elements and proper button
<div style={{ display: 'flex', alignItems: 'center', justifyContent: 'space-between', pointerEvents: 'none' }}>
  <span style={{ pointerEvents: 'auto' }}>{server.name || server.host}</span>
  <button onClick={closeTab} style={{ pointerEvents: 'auto' }}>×</button>
</div>
```

### Close Functionality
- **Proper session termination**: Close button now properly terminates active sessions before removing tabs
- **Clean DOM cleanup**: Removes event listeners and DOM elements properly
- **Status handling**: Shows disconnecting status during cleanup
- **Active tab management**: Properly switches to adjacent tabs when closing

### Reconnect Functionality
- **In-place reconnection**: Reconnect reuses the existing tab instead of creating new ones
- **Proper session lifecycle**: Terminates existing session before establishing new connection
- **Event-based communication**: Uses custom events for clean component communication
- **Visual feedback**: Shows disconnecting/connecting status during reconnection
- **Maintains clean DOM state**: No duplicate tabs or orphaned elements

## CSS Improvements

- Removed default Ant Design tab borders and backgrounds
- Flat design with subtle hover effects
- Proper spacing and alignment
- Responsive design

### Modern Close Button
- Centered × symbol
- Hover effects with color changes
- Proper sizing and positioning
- Consistent with modern UI patterns

## Usage

### Right-click Context Menu
- **Reconnect**: Cleanly closes and reopens the session

- Proper cleanup and DOM management

## Key Improvements

### 1. **Proper Session Termination**
- Close button now properly terminates active SSH/RDP connections before removing tabs
- Added `disconnecting` status to show proper cleanup process
- Prevents memory leaks and zombie connections

### 2. **In-Place Reconnection**
- Right-click "Reconnect" now reuses the existing tab instead of creating duplicates
- Properly terminates existing session before establishing new connection
- Maintains consistent UI and prevents tab proliferation

### 3. **Event-Based Communication**
- Uses custom DOM events (`reconnect`, `disconnect`) for clean component communication
- Eliminates direct DOM manipulation errors
- Provides better separation of concerns

### 4. **Enhanced Session Lifecycle**
- Added proper connection state validation during async operations
- Prevents race conditions during connect/disconnect operations
- Cleaner error handling and user feedback

### 6. **Enhanced Button Reliability**
- Changed close button from `<span>` to `<button>` element for better accessibility
- Added `pointerEvents: 'auto'` to ensure buttons receive click events properly
- Enhanced event handling with `preventDefault()` and `stopPropagation()`
- Added `onMouseDown` handler to prevent tab selection conflicts
- Improved CSS with proper button styling and hover effects
