## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**

   git clone <repository-url>
   cd my-electron-app
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the application:**
   ```
   npm start
   ```

## Building the Application

To create an executable file for your application, you can use a tool like `electron-builder`. Add the following script to your `package.json`:

```json
"scripts": {
  "build": "electron-builder"
}
```

Then run:

```
npm run build
```

This will generate an executable file in the `dist` directory.
